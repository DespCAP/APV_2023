The 3 mini-projects are stated below:
1. Estimate the occurrence of a supermoon using the ephemeris data for the moon.
2. Determine the type of galaxy(spiral, elliptical or merger) using spectral data.
3. Predict whether an object is a star or not (amongst Galaxies, QSOs and stars) [from a CSV file containing their spectra]. Using the predictions, also classify the type of star(red, yellow giants, or dwarfs etc.)
